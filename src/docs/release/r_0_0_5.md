# Release 0.0.5 (08.03.2025)

### Server Fix
API endpoints are not redirecting anymore if no slash is trailing.

Before it looked like this:
```
2025-03-08 16:18:37,511 [INFO ] server - 127.0.0.1 - POST /api/stundenplan - Code: 308
2025-03-08 16:18:39,465 [INFO ] server - 127.0.0.1 - POST /api/stundenplan/ - Code: 200
```
This was causing issues in Spring, because Spring is sensitive to redirects.


### Documentation Fix
Fixed the /docs documentation to work when server is running on windows. Issue was that windows uses \\ as seperator and linux uses /

### Improved Default Logging Configuration
Now more details are being logged when starting the server.

### HTTP Codes
Improved http codes for GET /api/stundenplan to be more precise in case no stundenplan output has been generated yet.
Previously was 500 internal server error, now 404 not found with a correct json response body.

### API Patch to Put
Changed the PATCH /api/stundenplan endpoint to expect a PUT request, with PATCH we had issues in the Spring frontend.

### Output Format Improved
Added the runtime information for the algorithm in the data.metadata field, runtime is in seconds with 2 decimal places precision.

### Input Format Reworked
Expecting now an array with timeslots { day: int, timeslot: int } instead of metadata to allow more flexibility for days with varying amouts of timeslots.

### Run Configuration

A pycharm/intellij run configuration has been added to start the server without docker
